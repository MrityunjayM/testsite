            <p class="text-justify">In April of 2021, a group of physicists at Fermilab performed ultra-precise measurements on an ephemeral particle called muon. However, the experimental value of muons magnetic moment was significantly different
              from what theory had predicted, enough to cause a stir among theoreticians. A similar result was previously measured at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and the results were declared in 2001.However, due to large uncertainties in
              theoretical predictions, it didn’t gather enough value even though it created stir in the scientific community. The theory has evolved over the years however the recent experiments at the Fermilab has proved that our understanding of
              the subatomic world is incomplete. <br><br>

              (The lifetime of muon is approximately 2.2 µs (10-6 s), hence the term ephemeral. The mass of muon is 105 MeV which is 200 times the mass of an electron which is 0.511 MeV)
              <br><br>
              *MeV is a unit measurement of mass in particle physics. MeV is 106 eV(electron volts)
              <br><br>
              1eV= 1.60218*10-19 Joule( an unit of energy)
              <br><br>
              In order to understand this result and its significance let’s first start by understanding a little bit about particles, the Standard Model of physics, and basic theory of magnetism.
